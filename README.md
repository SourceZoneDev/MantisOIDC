Notes
-----
1. Tested in MantisBT 2.25.2. Let me know if you are using other OpenID systems and your experiences with this plugin!
2. So far only tested with keycloak
3. When disabling the credentials input, curious users might still be able to login with username/password by sending a http POST request
4. Users are still able to directly open the lost password page `lost_pwd_page.php` and set their password within MantisBT. This will **NOT** affect the password in the OpenID system!
5. If there is trouble with authentication and you are locked out of the system without being able to enter credentials, go to the MantisBT database, find the table [mantis]_config_table, search for the value `plugin_MantisOIDC_hide_credentials_login` and set its value to `false`. This should reenable the login via credentials.
6. Translations available for English and German. More languages can be added under `plugins/MantisOIDC/lang`. Feel free to send a merge request with new languages added!
